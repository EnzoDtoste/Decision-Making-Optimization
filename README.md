# Thesis Project: Synergy of Probability, Optimization, and Machine Learning for Decision-Making

This repository contains the **code and notebooks** used in the thesis, integrating:
- **Probabilistic Decision Assignment** (e.g., inverted logarithmic, inverse proportional, etc.).
- **Metaheuristic Optimization** (PSO).
- **Machine Learning** (Transformer-based models) for the dynamic selection of parameters.

## Repository Structure
- **`src/`**: Main implementations of the functions and algorithms described in the thesis.
- **`notebooks/`**: Practical examples and validation tests on various decision-making problems.

## Project PDF
The full thesis document (PDF) is located in the **`docs/`** folder, providing in-depth theory, tests, and results.

## Requirements and Execution
To run the notebooks and code, ensure you have:
- **Python 3.9+**
- Scientific and **machine learning libraries** (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, PyTorch/TensorFlow).
- A virtual environment (conda or venv) is recommended to keep your installation clean.
